      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <img src="SZ-flag.jpg" alt="Switzerland Flag">
      <p> The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons but was expanded when localities started to join.</p> 
      <p> Switzerland was not involved in either of the two World Wars, what makes it one of the most neutral countries in Europe. </p>
      <p> Nowadays, Switzerland remains active in many United Nations and international organizations but retains a strong commitment to neutrality. </p>
      <p> However, the political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its neighbors. </p>
